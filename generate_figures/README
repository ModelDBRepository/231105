The simulation program produces the computational figures of the article:

Does Layer 4 in the barrel cortex function as a balanced circuit
when responding to whisker movements?
Tommer Argaman and David Golomb.

The directories are:

simulation_program: files of the simulation program in C of the
conductance-based model.

To compile the program, write:
make tc

generate_figures: There are 8 sub-directories, fig1 ... fig8.
to generate panels of figures 1...8, write:

cd fig{n} ({n}=1...8)
fig{n}.com

To generate panel 3D, simulate the integrate-and-fire model. Write:
cd integrate_and_fire
and follow ReadMe.txt there.
